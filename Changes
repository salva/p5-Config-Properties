Revision history for Perl extension Config::Properties.

0.41  Tue Jul 10 00:00:00 2002
	- Fixed value checks in most methods that incorrectly treated the
	  value '0' or the empty string as an undefined value. I could not
	  contact the original author in any way (tried 3 email addresses 
	  and news://comp.lang.perl.modules), so I uploaded this version
	  myself. Craig Manley (c.manley at skybound.nl).
